      <p>Hello and welcome to my main webpage! I'm Hasan and currently I'm a second year at IIT majoring in Applied Cybersecuirty and InfoTech. In this project, one of the webpage is my resume while this and my other page are about taking pictures within video games using different external photomod tools and applications.</p>

      <p>One of my hobbies is taking pictures inside video games especially in Cyberpunk_2077. In the image above, I took a screenshot mid of my photo session for a possible shot. As you may notice there are different lighting assets that can be manipulated in order to make the image look according to the vision.</p>

      <p>If you click the "Video Game Photography" page above, you will find further in depth information about what and how I use tools to take pictures in this game.</p>
