      <h2 class="main-title">Tools and How To Use the Tools</h2>
      <p class="light-blue-text">The images above are photos that I took using Otis_inf photomode tool from Patreon and mods for this game that can be found in Nexusmods.com</p>
      <p class="light-blue-text">Otis_inf tool is basically a photo-mode injection tool which runs while the game is running in order to work together. When you have your character set, there is a lighting tool allowing you to add artificial light to make the image look more realistic. Next step would be to configure the images depth of field than moving onto to implement an asset modifier called "Realistic Long Exposure" which at your desired length, will start to polish the image linings - boundaries of target of your target. Than we have to move to the injection tool by Otis, where we can manipulate teh target body rig to be in our desired position and finally hotsample the image at a higher resolution for a higher quality image.</p>
      <p class="light-blue-text">These features are available in a game asset modifier software called Reshade where I can manipulate in-game assets such as image sharpening, light settings, field of view, lens aperture, and long exposure units.</p>
